# CID-2025-003: Retroactive Governance for Execution Epoch Documentation

**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Type:** Governance / Documentation (Operational metadata definition)  
**Status:** Approved (Retroactive)

---

## Summary

Retroactive CID governing commit `cdce180` which added execution epoch documentation to organ documents. This CID was created to comply with GOVERNANCE_PHASED_PLAN.md requirements that semantic organ doc changes require CID governance even in Phase 0.

**Explicit Statement:** No UTG changes; no BRD changes; no new gates.

## Governed Commit

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Hash** | `cdce180` |
| **Message** | UVS V20.6.6: Add Execution Epoch Documentation |
| **Date** | 2025-12-28 |

---

## Documents Changed

| Document | Change | Version |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `UNIFIED_VERIFICATION_SPECIFICATION_V20_6_6.md` | Added §8.1.4 Execution Epochs definition | V20.6.5 → V20.6.6 |
| `LEDGER_COVERAGE_SPEC.md` | Added epoch fields, REQ-6, project-scoped paths | V1.0 → V2.0 |
| `A3_SI_CHECKPOINT.md` | Added epoch evidence section | — |
| `CURSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V20_8_5.md` | Added epoch scoping note | — |
| `EXIT.md` | Added epoch metadata items to Pillar Verification | v1.5.3 → v1.5.4 |

---

## Enforceable Rule

> **UVS §8.1.4 is the only normative definition of execution epochs.**
>
> All other documents may reference UVS §8.1.4 but MUST NOT redefine epoch semantics.

This rule prevents Track B/C/D authors from "improving" epoch semantics inside other documents.

## What Epochs Are (and Are NOT)

### Epochs ARE

- Operational metadata for execution scoping
- Ledger/corpus auditability mechanisms
- Replay and provenance enablers
- Explicitly **non-normative** operational constructs

### Epochs Are NOT

| Explicitly NOT | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| Traceability entities (E-codes) | Operational metadata, not domain concepts |
| Relationships (R-codes) | Scope entries, not connect entities |
| UTG schema elements | Not part of the traceability graph |
| Verification gates | Epoch completion is not a pass/fail criterion |
| Success/failure criteria | Reproducibility ≠ correctness |

---

## Verification Evidence

### 1.1 Organ Parity Check

**Command:** `npm run verify:organ-parity`

**Result:** 10 PASS, 1 WARN, 0 FAIL

```
WARN: endmarker-parity
  File: docs/UNIFIED_VERIFICATION_SPECIFICATION_V20_6_6.md
  Header (20.6.6) != End-marker (20.6.5)
  Details: {"headerVersion":"20.6.6","endMarkerVersion":"20.6.5"}

Summary: 10 pass, 1 warn, 0 fail
Exit: 0 (Phase 0 = warnings only)
```

**Warning Classification:** `ALLOWED`

**Rationale:** The UVS end-marker reads "V20.6.5" but header reads "V20.6.6". This is a cosmetic version string mismatch in the governed commit `cdce180` itself — the epoch documentation was added but the end-marker was not updated. This warning:
- Does NOT affect epoch semantic correctness
- Does NOT introduce new E-codes or R-codes
- Does NOT change BRD, UTG, or gate counts
- WILL become a blocker in Phase 1+ (per GOVERNANCE_PHASED_PLAN.md)

**Action Required:** Fix end-marker before Phase 1 transition (separate CID).

### 1.2 Semantic Code Scan

**Purpose:** Confirm epoch sections introduce no new E##/R## codes.

**UVS §8.1.4 Section:** Lines 1871-1973 (ends before §8.1.5 at line 1974)

**Proof Excerpt (Lines 1871-1877):**
```markdown
### 8.1.4 Execution Epochs (Non-Normative Operational Definition)

> **Non-Normative Operational Definition**
>
> The execution epoch is an operational construct used to scope ledger entries, 
> corpus signals, and decisions to a single extraction run.
> It is **not** a traceability entity, semantic artifact, or correctness signal.
```

**Manual Review Findings:**
- Section explicitly states epochs are NOT traceability entities
- "What Epochs Are NOT" table (lines 1940-1948) confirms: no E-codes, no R-codes
- Grep `\bE[0-9]{2}\b|\bR[0-9]{2}\b` on lines 1871-1973 returns 0 matches
- **No new semantic codes introduced by epoch section**

### 1.3 UVS Reference Check

**Command:** `grep "UVS.*8\.1\.4|UNIFIED_VERIFICATION_SPECIFICATION.*8\.1\.4"`

**Result:** All non-UVS docs properly reference UVS §8.1.4:

| Document | Reference Found |
|----------|-----------------|
| LEDGER_COVERAGE_SPEC.md | Line 6, Line 14 |
| A3_SI_CHECKPOINT.md | Line 4, Line 12 |
| CURSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md | Line 163 |
| EXIT.md | Line 219 |

### 1.4 No Redefinition Check

**Command:** `grep "##+.*epoch.*definition|##+.*execution epochs"` on non-UVS docs

**Result:** 0 matches — No epoch definition headings in non-UVS documents

### 1.5 Existing CID Files

**Command:** `ls -1 docs/verification/CID-*.md`

**Verbatim Result:**
```
docs/verification/CID-2025-001.md
docs/verification/CID-2025-002.md
docs/verification/CID-2025-003.md
```

All 3 CID_LOG entries are file-backed.

## Impact Assessment

| Category | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| BRD | None — no acceptance criteria modified |
| UTG Schema | None — epochs explicitly excluded from UTG |
| Gates | None — no gate thresholds changed |
| Invariants | None — locked invariants unchanged |
| Semantic Entities | None — no E-codes or R-codes added |
