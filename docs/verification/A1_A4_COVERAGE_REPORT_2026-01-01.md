## Section 6 — Acceptance Criteria Coverage (E03 → R19)

### 6.1 Expected Universe

Total E03 AcceptanceCriterion entities in DB: 3147

### 6.2 Observed Link

ACs with at least one R19 SATISFIES relationship: 22

### 6.3 Summary

| Total_ACs | ACs_with_R19 | ACs_without_R19 |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 3147 | 22 | 3125 |

**Coverage Rate:** 0.70%

### 6.4 Rule-Based Classification

**Classification Rules:**

1. **IMPLEMENTED** — AC has R19 relationship (has `@satisfies` marker in code)
2. **VERIFIED_BY_TEST** — Performance/behavioral AC verified by test evidence (not R19)
3. **DEFERRED/OUT_OF_SCOPE** — AC is explicitly listed in `DEFERRED_ACS` with citation
4. **GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION** — Parent story has R18 AND AC is in TDD scope, but lacks R19/test

**Semantic Distinction:**
- R19 (SATISFIES): Code satisfies ACs via `@satisfies` markers
- VERIFIED_BY_TEST: Tests verify behavior/performance (test file evidence)

**Governing Spec Citations:**
- TDD scope per story: `spec/track_a/stories/A{1-5}_*.md` (addresses.acceptance_criteria)
- A4 out-of-scope: R24 requires E14 (Interface), deferred post-Track A
- A4/A5 subset: Only specific ACs are in Track A scope

### 6.5 Classification Results

| Classification | Count | Evidence |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| IMPLEMENTED (has R19) | 22 | R19 exists in relationships table |
| VERIFIED_BY_TEST (performance/behavior) | 1 | Test file with evidence |
| GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION (in-scope, missing marker) | 10 | In TDD scope but lacks @satisfies/test |
| OUT_OF_SCOPE/DEFERRED (explicit) | 13 | Per TDD frontmatter / spec citations |
| DEFERRED (story not implemented) | 3101 | Parent story has no R18 |

**Strict Mode:** DISABLED (gaps = advisory)

### 6.6 Gap List (In-Scope ACs Missing R19)

| AC_ID | Parent_STORY_ID | In_TDD_Scope | R19_Count | Classification | Reason |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| AC-64.1.2 | STORY-64.1 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.1.4 | STORY-64.1 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.1.8 | STORY-64.1 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.2.6 | STORY-64.2 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.2.7 | STORY-64.2 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.2.8 | STORY-64.2 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.5.1 | STORY-64.5 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.5.2 | STORY-64.5 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.5.3 | STORY-64.5 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |
| AC-64.5.4 | STORY-64.5 | ✅ Yes | 0 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION | In-scope AC without @satisfies marker |

### 6.7 Gaps by Story Summary (In-Scope Only)

| Story_ID | In_Scope_Gaps | Classification |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| STORY-64.1 | 3 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION |
| STORY-64.2 | 3 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION |
| STORY-64.5 | 4 | GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION |

### 6.8 Verified-by-Test ACs (Performance/Behavioral Evidence)

These ACs are satisfied by test evidence, not R19 code markers.
This is the correct semantic: tests verify behavior/performance, code markers verify implementation.

**Evidence Requirements (BOTH must be present):**
1. `@satisfies AC-XX.YY.ZZ` marker in test file
2. Actual assertion matching the expected pattern

| AC_ID | Test_File | Marker_Found | Marker_Line | Assertion_Found | Assertion_Line |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| AC-64.4.10 | `test/pipeline/pipeline.integration.test.ts` | ✅ | 169 | ✅ | 179 |

**Assertion Evidence:**

- **AC-64.4.10** (line 179): `expect(result.total_duration_ms).toBeLessThan(15 * 60 * 1000);`

### 6.9 Deferred/Out-of-Scope ACs (Not Counted as Gaps)

| AC_ID | Parent_STORY_ID | Classification | Citation |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| AC-64.3.10 | STORY-64.3 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A3 TDD scope |
| AC-64.4.4 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Deferred: R24 requires E14 (Interface) which is out-of-scope for Track A |
| AC-64.4.5 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Out of Track A subset (spec/track_a/stories/A4_STRUCTURAL_ANALYSIS.md) |
| AC-64.4.6 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Out of Track A subset |
| AC-64.4.7 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Out of Track A subset |
| AC-64.4.8 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Out of Track A subset |
| AC-64.4.9 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Out of Track A subset |
| AC-64.5.10 | STORY-64.5 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A5 TDD scope |
| AC-64.5.5 | STORY-64.5 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A5 TDD scope (spec/track_a/stories/A5_GRAPH_API_V1.md) |
| AC-64.5.6 | STORY-64.5 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A5 TDD scope |
| AC-64.5.7 | STORY-64.5 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A5 TDD scope |
| AC-64.5.8 | STORY-64.5 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A5 TDD scope |
| AC-64.5.9 | STORY-64.5 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A5 TDD scope |

### 6.10 Deferred Summary (Stories Not Yet Implemented)

387 stories have no R18 (IMPLEMENTS) markers, containing 3101 ACs.
These are legitimately DEFERRED per Track A scope — implementation has not started.

## Section 12 — Final Verdict

### 12.1 SYSTEM COMPLETENESS (Track A Infrastructure)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Entity/Relationship Universes | ✅ Pass |
| BRD Parity | ✅ Pass |
| Evidence Anchors | ✅ Pass |
| Referential Integrity | ✅ Pass |
| PG↔Neo4j Parity | ✅ Pass |
| Ledger Present | ✅ Pass |
| Epochs Present | ✅ Pass |
| Marker Governance | ✅ Pass |

**SYSTEM VERDICT:** ✅ **PASS**

### 12.2 ANNOTATION COMPLETENESS (Content Coverage)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ACs with @satisfies markers (R19) | 35 |
| ACs verified by test evidence | 1 |
| In-scope gaps (missing markers/tests) | 10 |
| Out-of-scope/deferred (explicit) | 13 |
| Deferred (stories not implemented) | ~3100 |

**ANNOTATION VERDICT:** ⚠️ **10 GAPS** (see Section 6.6)

**Performance/Behavioral ACs:** AC-64.4.10 (verified by test evidence, see Section 6.8)

**Gap Stories:** STORY-64.1, STORY-64.2, STORY-64.5

**Note:** Only in-scope ACs per TDD frontmatter are counted as gaps.
Out-of-scope ACs (e.g., AC-64.4.4 through AC-64.4.9) are listed in Section 6.9 with citations.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Add `@satisfies AC-XX.YY.ZZ` markers to functions/classes implementing these ACs
2. For infrastructure-only ACs, document justification in code comments
3. Create a CID to track gaps with remediation timeline

### 12.3 Combined Verdict

| Mode | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Strict Mode | DISABLED |
| System Completeness | PASS |
| Annotation Completeness | 10 GAPS |
| **Final Verdict** | ✅ **PASS** |

Track A infrastructure is complete. Annotation gaps are advisory and do not block progression.
