## Section 6 — Acceptance Criteria Coverage (E03 → R19)

### 6.1 Expected Universe

Total E03 AcceptanceCriterion entities in DB: 3147

### 6.2 Observed Link

ACs with at least one R19 SATISFIES relationship: 18

### 6.3 Summary

| Total_ACs | ACs_with_R19 | ACs_without_R19 |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 3147 | 18 | 3129 |

**Coverage Rate:** 0.57%

### 6.4 Rule-Based Classification

**Classification Rules:**

1. **IMPLEMENTED** — AC has R19 relationship (has `@satisfies` marker)
2. **DEFERRED/OUT_OF_SCOPE** — AC is explicitly listed in `DEFERRED_ACS` with citation, OR not in story's TDD `addresses.acceptance_criteria`
3. **GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION** — Parent story has R18 AND AC is in TDD scope, but lacks R19

**Governing Spec Citations:**
- TDD scope per story: `spec/track_a/stories/A{1-5}_*.md` (addresses.acceptance_criteria)
- A4 out-of-scope: R24 requires E14 (Interface), deferred post-Track A
- A4/A5 subset: Only specific ACs are in Track A scope

### 6.5 Classification Results

| Classification | Count | Evidence |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| IMPLEMENTED (has R19) | 18 | R19 exists in relationships table |
| GAP_PENDING_ANNOTATION (in-scope, missing marker) | 15 | In TDD scope but lacks @satisfies |
| OUT_OF_SCOPE/DEFERRED (explicit) | 13 | Per TDD frontmatter / spec citations |
| DEFERRED (story not implemented) | 3101 | Parent story has no R18 |

**Strict Mode:** DISABLED (gaps = advisory)

### 6.6 Gap List (In-Scope ACs Missing R19)

| AC-64.3.10 | STORY-64.3 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not in A3 TDD scope |
| AC-64.4.4 | STORY-64.4 | OUT_OF_SCOPE | Deferred: R24 requires E14 (Interface) which is out-of-scope for Track A |

## Section 12 — Final Verdict

### 12.1 SYSTEM COMPLETENESS (Track A Infrastructure)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Entity/Relationship Universes | ✅ Pass |
| BRD Parity | ✅ Pass |
| Evidence Anchors | ✅ Pass |
| Referential Integrity | ✅ Pass |
| PG↔Neo4j Parity | ✅ Pass |
| Ledger Present | ✅ Pass |
| Epochs Present | ✅ Pass |
| Marker Governance | ✅ Pass |

**SYSTEM VERDICT:** ✅ **PASS**

### 12.2 ANNOTATION COMPLETENESS (Content Coverage)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ACs with @satisfies markers (R19) | 31 |
| In-scope gaps (missing markers) | 15 |
| Out-of-scope/deferred (explicit) | 13 |
| Deferred (stories not implemented) | ~3100 |

**ANNOTATION VERDICT:** ⚠️ **15 GAPS** (see Section 6.6)

**Gap Stories:** STORY-64.1, STORY-64.2, STORY-64.4, STORY-64.5

**Note:** Only in-scope ACs per TDD frontmatter are counted as gaps.
Out-of-scope ACs (e.g., AC-64.4.4 through AC-64.4.9) are listed in Section 6.8 with citations.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Add `@satisfies AC-XX.YY.ZZ` markers to functions/classes implementing these ACs
2. For infrastructure-only ACs, document justification in code comments
3. Create a CID to track gaps with remediation timeline

### 12.3 Combined Verdict

| Mode | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Strict Mode | DISABLED |
| System Completeness | PASS |
| Annotation Completeness | 15 GAPS |
| **Final Verdict** | ✅ **PASS** |

Track A infrastructure is complete. Annotation gaps are advisory and do not block progression.
